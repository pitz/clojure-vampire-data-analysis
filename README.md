#### A Vampire Data Analysis!

Another piece of code using Clojure. 

I'm reading a book called "Clojure for the Brave and True" and this is an example from there. It's a really simple example and I tried to reproduce myself. Now, I'll use my knowledge in the Core Functions of Clojure. In this project, it's possible to see some Collection Abstraction, Lazy Seqs and Seq Functions.

The goal is to analyze a file (CSV) with vampire data.
